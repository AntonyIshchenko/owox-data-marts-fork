![JavaScript Open-Source Connectors](res/main-cover.png)
## Why
At OWOX, we believe everyone should have easy access to data. That is why we have open-sourced data connectors to empower every business to become data owners by importing it into Spreadsheets or DWHs.
Although there are many great SaaS and open-source products available, we see the need for a solution that offers a free cloud version and doesnâ€™t require data engineers for maintenance.

## What
With just a few clicks and no coding, you can easily set up automated data imports into your spreadsheets and earn the following benefits:
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Being open-source, no credentials need to be shared with third-party products.
- **Unlimited Customization**: Scheduling and data schemas can be adjusted at any time.
- **Streamlined Tech Stack**: Connectors can be developed and customized via Apps Script. Google Sheets is more than enough to run your own data pipelines
- **Free**: Distributed under the ELv2 license, it allows free use for internal organizational services or providing paid services to clients, as long as it is not used to build a competing product.
- **Serverless**: neither Google Cloud nor computing resources are required to run it
